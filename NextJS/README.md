In this repository, I am coding along with the "Next.js & React - The Complete Guide" course by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller on Udemy. As I progress through the course, I am gaining valuable knowledge and hands-on experience in building highly dynamic, super fast, and SEO-ready React apps using React and Next.js.
