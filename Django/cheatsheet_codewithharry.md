What is Django?
Python-based web framework used for rapid development of web applications.

Installing Django + Setup
pip install django
Creating a project
The below command creates a new project named projectName

django-admin startproject projectName
Starting a server
The below command starts the development server.

python manage.py runserver
Django MVT
Django follows MVT(Model, View, Template) architecture.

Sample Django Model
The model represents the schema of the database.

from django.db import models

class Product(models.Model): # Product is the name of our model
    product_id=models.AutoField
Sample views.py
View decides what data gets delivered to the template.

from django.http import HttpResponse

def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("Django CodeWithHarry Cheatsheet")
Sample HTML Template
A sample .html file that contains HTML, CSS and Javascript.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
    <title>CodeWithHarry Cheatsheet</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>This is a sample template file.</h1>
</body>
</html>
Views in Django
Sample Function-Based Views
A python function that takes a web request and returns a web response.

from django.http import HttpResponse

def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("This is a function based view.")
Sample Class-Based Views
Django's class-based views provide an object-oriented way of organizing your view code.

from django.views import View

class SimpleClassBasedView(View):
    def get(self, request):
        pass # Code to process a GET request
URLs in Django
Set of URL patterns to be matched against the requested URL.

Sample urls.py file1
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlPatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', views.index, name='index'),
    path('about/', views.about, name='about'),
]
Sample urls.py file2
from django.urls import include, path

urlpatterns = [
    # ... snip ...
    path('community/', include('aggregator.urls')),
    path('contact/', include('contact.urls')),
    # ... snip ...
]
Forms in Django
Similar to HTML forms but are created by Django using the form field.

Sample Django form
from django import forms

# creating a form
class SampleForm(forms.Form):
    name = forms.CharField()
    description = forms.CharField()
Apps in Django
Apps in Django are like independent modules for different functionalities.

Creating an app
python manage.py startapp AppName
Listing app in the settings.py
After creating an app, we need to list the app name in INSTALLED_APPS

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'AppName'
]
Templates in Django
Used to handle dynamic HTML files separately.

Configuring templates in settings.py
TEMPLATES = [
    {
        'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
        'DIRS': ["templates"],
        'APP_DIRS': True,
        'OPTIONS': {
            # some options here
        },
    },
]
Changing the views.py file
A view is associated with every URL. This view is responsible for displaying the content from the template.

def index(request):
    return render(request, 'index.html') #render is used to return the template
Sample template file
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Template is working</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>This is a sample django template.</h1>
</body>
</html>
Migrations in Django
Migrations are Django's way of updating the database schema according to the changes that you make to your models.

Creating a migration
The below command is used to make migration (create files with information to update database) but no changes are made to the actual database.

python manage.py makemigrations
Applying the migration
The below command is used to apply the changes to the actual database.

python manage.py migrate
Admin interface in Django
Django comes with a ready-to-use admin interface.

Creating the admin user
python manage.py createsuperuser
Page Redirection
Redirection is used to redirect the user to a specific page of the application on the occurrence of an event.

Redirect method
from django.shortcuts import render, redirect

def redirecting(request):
    return redirect("https://www.codewithharry.com")
