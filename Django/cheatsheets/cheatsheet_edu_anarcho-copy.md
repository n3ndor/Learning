Python Crash Course

Building a simple home page
Users interact with a project through web pages, and a
project’s home page can start out as a simple page with no
data. A page usually needs a URL, a view, and a template.
Mapping a project’s URLs
The project’s main urls.py file tells Django where to find the urls.py
files associated with each app in the project.
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include
urlpatterns = [
 path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
 path('', include('learning_logs.urls')),
]
Mapping an app’s URLs
An app’s urls.py file tells Django which view to use for each URL in
the app. You’ll need to make this file yourself, and save it in the
app’s folder.
from django.urls import path
from . import views
app_name = 'learning_logs'
urlpatterns = [
 # Home page.
 path('', views.index, name='index'),
]
Writing a simple view
A view takes information from a request and sends data to the
browser, often through a template. View functions are stored in an
app’s views.py file. This simple view function doesn’t pull in any
data, but it uses the template index.html to render the home page.
from django.shortcuts import render
def index(request):
 """The home page for Learning Log."""
 return render(request,
 'learning_logs/index.html')
What is Django?
Django is a web framework which helps you build
interactive websites using Python. With Django you
define the kind of data your site needs to work with,
and you define the ways your users can work with
that data.
Installing Django
It’s usually best to install Django to a virtual environment,
where your project can be isolated from your other Python
projects. Most commands assume you’re working in an
active virtual environment.
Create a virtual environment
$ python –m venv ll_env
Activate the environment (macOS and Linux)
$ source ll_env/bin/activate
Activate the environment (Windows)
> ll_env\Scripts\activate
Install Django to the active environment
(ll_env)$ pip install Django
Working with models
The data in a Django project is structured as a set of
models.
Defining a model
To define the models for your app, modify the file models.py that
was created in your app’s folder. The __str__() method tells
Django how to represent data objects based on this model.
from django.db import models
class Topic(models.Model):
 """A topic the user is learning about."""
 text = models.CharField(max_length=200)
 date_added = models.DateTimeField(
 auto_now_add=True)

 def __str__(self):
 return self.text
Activating a model
To use a model the app must be added to the list
INSTALLED_APPS, which is stored in the project’s settings.py file.
INSTALLED_APPS = [
 # My apps.
 'learning_logs',
 # Default Django apps.
 'django.contrib.admin',
]
Migrating the database
The database needs to be modified to store the kind of data that
the model represents. You'll need to run these commands every
time you create a new model, or modify an existing model.
$ python manage.py makemigrations learning_logs
$ python manage.py migrate
Creating a superuser
A superuser is a user account that has access to all aspects of the
project.
$ python manage.py createsuperuser
Registering a model
You can register your models with Django’s admin site, which
makes it easier to work with the data in your project. To do this,
modify the app’s admin.py file. View the admin site at
http://localhost:8000/admin/.
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Topic
admin.site.register(Topic)

Cheat Sheet – Django
Creating a project
To start a project we’ll create a new project, create a
database, and start a development server.
Create a new project
$ django-admin startproject learning_log .
Create a database
$ python manage.py migrate
View the project
After issuing this command, you can view the project at
http://localhost:8000/.
$ python manage.py runserver
Create a new app
A Django project is made up of one or more apps.
$ python manage.py startapp learning_logs
Online resources
The documentation for Django is available at
http://docs.djangoproject.com/. The Django documentation
is thorough and user-friendly, so check it out!
Building a simple home page (cont.)
Writing a simple template
A template sets up the structure for a page. It’s a mix of html and
template code, which is like Python but not as powerful. Make a
folder called templates inside the project folder. Inside the
templates folder make another folder with the same name as the
app. This is where the template files should be saved.
 The home page template will be saved as
learning_logs/templates/learning_logs/index.html.
<p>Learning Log</p>
<p>Learning Log helps you keep track of your
learning, for any topic you're learning
about.</p>
Another model
A new model can use an existing model. The ForeignKey
attribute establishes a connection between instances of the
two related models. Make sure to migrate the database
after adding a new model to your app.
Defining a model with a foreign key
class Entry(models.Model):
 """Learning log entries for a topic."""
 topic = models.ForeignKey(Topic,
 on_delete=models.CASCADE)
 text = models.TextField()
 date_added = models.DateTimeField(
 auto_now_add=True)

 def __str__(self):
 return f"{self.text[:50]}..."
Building a page with data (cont.)
Using data in a template
The data in the view function’s context dictionary is available
within the template. This data is accessed using template
variables, which are indicated by doubled curly braces.
 The vertical line after a template variable indicates a filter. In this
case a filter called date formats date objects, and the filter
linebreaks renders paragraphs properly on a web page.
{% extends 'learning_logs/base.html' %}
{% block content %}
 <p>Topic: {{ topic }}</p>
 <p>Entries:</p>
 <ul>
 {% for entry in entries %}
 <li>
 <p>
 {{ entry.date_added|date:'M d, Y H:i' }}
 </p>
 <p>
 {{ entry.text|linebreaks }}
 </p>
 </li>
 {% empty %}
 <li>There are no entries yet.</li>
 {% endfor %}
 </ul>

{% endblock content %}
Template inheritance
Many elements of a web page are repeated on every page
in the site, or every page in a section of the site. By writing
one parent template for the site, and one for each section,
you can easily modify the look and feel of your entire site.
The parent template
The parent template defines the elements common to a set of
pages, and defines blocks that will be filled by individual pages.
<p>
 <a href="{% url 'learning_logs:index' %}">
 Learning Log
 </a>
</p>
{% block content %}{% endblock content %}
The child template
The child template uses the {% extends %} template tag to pull in
the structure of the parent template. It then defines the content for
any blocks defined in the parent template.
{% extends 'learning_logs/base.html' %}
{% block content %}
 <p>
 Learning Log helps you keep track
 of your learning, for any topic you're
 learning about.
 </p>
{% endblock content %}
Building a page with data
Most pages in a project need to present data that’s specific
to the current user.
URL parameters
A URL often needs to accept a parameter telling it which data to
access from the database. The URL pattern shown here looks for
the ID of a specific topic and assigns it to the parameter topic_id.
urlpatterns = [
 --snip--
 # Detail page for a single topic.
 path('topics/<int:topic_id>/', views.topic,
 name='topic'),
]
Using data in a view
The view uses a parameter from the URL to pull the correct data
from the database. In this example the view is sending a context
dictionary to the template, containing data that should be displayed
on the page. You'll need to import any model you're using.
def topic(request, topic_id):
 """Show a topic and all its entries."""
 topic = Topic.objects.get(id=topic_id)
 entries = topic.entry_set.order_by(
 '-date_added')
 context = {
 'topic': topic,
 'entries': entries,
 }
 return render(request,
 'learning_logs/topic.html', context)
The Django shell
You can explore the data in your project from the command
line. This is helpful for developing queries and testing code
snippets.
Start a shell session
$ python manage.py shell
Access data from the project
>>> from learning_logs.models import Topic
>>> Topic.objects.all()
[<Topic: Chess>, <Topic: Rock Climbing>]
>>> topic = Topic.objects.get(id=1)
>>> topic.text
'Chess'
Restarting the development server
If you make a change to your project and the change
doesn’t seem to have any effect, try restarting the server:
$ python manage.py runserver
Template indentation
Python code is usually indented by four spaces. In
templates you’ll often see two spaces used for indentation,
because elements tend to be nested more deeply in
templates.
User accounts (cont.)
Showing the current login status
You can modify the base.html template to show whether the user is
currently logged in, and to provide a link to the login and logout
pages. Django makes a user object available to every template,
and this template takes advantage of this object.
 The user.is_authenticated tag allows you to serve specific
content to users depending on whether they have logged in or not.
The {{ user.username }} property allows you to greet users
who have logged in. Users who haven’t logged in see links to
register or log in.
<p>
 <a href="{% url 'learning_logs:index' %}">
 Learning Log
 </a>
 {% if user.is_authenticated %}
 Hello, {{ user.username }}.
 <a href="{% url 'users:logout' %}">
 Log out
 </a>
 {% else %}
 <a href="{% url 'users:register' %}">
 Register
 </a> -
 <a href="{% url 'users:login' %}">
 Log in
 </a>
 {% endif %}
</p>
{% block content %}{% endblock content %}
The logged_out template
The default logout view renders the page using the template
logged_out.html, which needs to be saved in the
users/templates/registration folder.
{% extends "learning_logs/base.html" %}
{% block content %}
 <p>
 You have been logged out. Thank you
 for visiting!
 </p>
{% endblock content %}
User accounts
User accounts are handled by a dedicated app called
users. Users need to be able to register, log in, and log
out. Django automates much of this work for you.
Making a users app
After making the app, be sure to add 'users' to INSTALLED_APPS
in the project’s settings.py file.
$ python manage.py startapp users
Including URLS for the users app
Add a line to the project’s urls.py file so the users app’s URLs are
included in the project.
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include
urlpatterns = [
 path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
 path('users/', include('users.urls')),
 path('', include('learning_logs.urls')),
]
User accounts (cont.)
Defining the URLs
Users will need to be able to log in, log out, and register. Make a
new urls.py file in the users app folder.
from django.urls import path, include
from . import views
app_name = 'users'
urlpatterns = [
 # Include default auth urls.
 path('', include(
 'django.contrib.auth.urls')),
 # Registration page.
 path('register/', views.register,
 name='register'),
]
The login template
The login view is provided by default, but you need to provide your
own login template. The template shown here displays a simple
login form, and provides basic error messages. Make a templates
folder in the users folder, and then make a registration folder in the
templates folder. Save this file as login.html.
 The tag {% csrf_token %} helps prevent a common type of
attack with forms. The {{ form.as_p }} element displays the
default login form in paragraph format. The <input> element
named next redirects the user to the home page after a successful
login.
{% extends "learning_logs/base.html" %}
{% block content %}
 {% if form.errors %}
 <p>
 Your username and password didn't match.
 Please try again.
 </p>
 {% endif %}

 <form method="post"
 action="{% url 'users:login' %}">
 {% csrf token %}
 {{ form.as_p }}
 <button name="submit">Log in</button>

 <input type="hidden" name="next"
 value="{% url 'learning_logs:index' %}"/>
 </form>

{% endblock content %}

Cheat Sheet –
Django, Part 2
Users and forms
Most web applications need to let users create
accounts. This lets users create and work with their
own data. Some of this data may be private, and
some may be public. Django’s forms allow users to
enter and modify their data.
Using forms in Django
There are a number of ways to create forms and work with
them. You can use Django’s defaults, or completely
customize your forms. For a simple way to let users enter
data based on your models, use a ModelForm. This creates
a form that allows users to enter data that will populate the
fields on a model.
 The register view on the back of this sheet shows a simple
approach to form processing. If the view doesn’t receive
data from a form, it responds with a blank form. If it
receives POST data from a form, it validates the data and
then saves it to the database.
User accounts (cont.)
The register view
The register view needs to display a blank registration form when
the page is first requested, and then process completed
registration forms. A successful registration logs the user in and
redirects to the home page.
from django.shortcuts import render, redirect
from django.contrib.auth import login
from django.contrib.auth.forms import \
 UserCreationForm
def register(request):
 """Register a new user."""
 if request.method != 'POST':
 # Display blank registration form.
 form = UserCreationForm()
 else:
 # Process completed form.
 form = UserCreationForm(
 data=request.POST)

 if form.is_valid():
 new_user = form.save()
 # Log in, redirect to home page.
 login(request, new_user)
 return redirect(
 'learning_logs:index')
 # Display a blank or invalid form.
 context = {'form': form}
 return render(request,
 'registration/register.html', context)
User accounts (cont.)
The register template
The register.html template displays the registration form in
paragraph formats.
{% extends 'learning_logs/base.html' %}
{% block content %}
 <form method='post'
 action="{% url 'users:register' %}">

 {% csrf_token %}
 {{ form.as_p }}

 <button name='submit'>Register</button>
 <input type='hidden' name='next'
 value="{% url 'learning_logs:index' %}"/>

 </form>
{% endblock content %}

Connecting data to users (cont.)
Restricting access to logged-in users
Some pages are only relevant to registered users. The views for
these pages can be protected by the @login_required decorator.
Any view with this decorator will automatically redirect non-logged
in users to an appropriate page. Here’s an example views.py file.
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import \
 login_required
--snip--
@login_required
def topic(request, topic_id):
 """Show a topic and all its entries."""
Setting the redirect URL
The @login_required decorator sends unauthorized users to the
login page. Add the following line to your project’s settings.py file
so Django will know how to find your login page.
LOGIN_URL = 'users:login'
Preventing inadvertent access
Some pages serve data based on a parameter in the URL. You
can check that the current user owns the requested data, and
return a 404 error if they don’t. Here’s an example view.
from django.http import Http404
--snip--
@login_required
def topic(request, topic_id):
 """Show a topic and all its entries."""
 topic = Topics.objects.get(id=topic_id)
 if topic.owner != request.user:
 raise Http404
 --snip--
Connecting data to users
Users will have data that belongs to them. Any model that should
be connected directly to a user needs a field connecting instances
of the model to a specific user.
Making a topic belong to a user
Only the highest-level data in a hierarchy needs to be directly
connected to a user. To do this import the User model, and add it
as a foreign key on the data model.
 After modifying the model you’ll need to migrate the database.
You’ll need to choose a user ID to connect each existing instance
to.
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
class Topic(models.Model):
 """A topic the user is learning about."""
 text = models.CharField(max_length=200)
 date_added = models.DateTimeField(
 auto_now_add=True)
 owner = models.ForeignKey(User,
 on_delete=models.CASCADE)

 def __str__(self):
 return self.text
Querying data for the current user
In a view, the request object has a user attribute. You can use this
attribute to query for the user’s data. The filter() method then
pulls the data that belongs to the current user.
topics = Topic.objects.filter(
 owner=request.user)
Styling your project
The django-bootstrap4 app allows you to use the Bootstrap
library to make your project look visually appealing. The
app provides tags that you can use in your templates to
style individual elements on a page. Learn more at
https://django-bootstrap4.readthedocs.io/.
Using a form to edit data
If you provide some initial data, Django generates a form
with the user’s existing data. Users can then modify and
save their data.
Creating a form with initial data
The instance parameter allows you to specify initial data for a form.
form = EntryForm(instance=entry)
Modifying data before saving
The argument commit=False allows you to make changes before
writing data to the database.
new_topic = form.save(commit=False)
new_topic.owner = request.user
new_topic.save()
